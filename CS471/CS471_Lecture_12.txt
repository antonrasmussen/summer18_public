TOday -  Finish up data comm stuff, get into data security next week

We've already seen routing and topologies, so we're going to deal with the other items that data comm has

One is contention

Single LAN is a broadcast env. meaning everyone gets everything


two architectures from monday: bus env and ring env



https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802
802.1 - hardware stds
802.2 - software stds

.3,.4,.5 = access methods => .3 = ethernet = CSMA/CD, a contention network with an limited number of collisions with resolution done with random number generation

vOLTMETER ON bus at A ... if there's nothing, then start talking... B does same thing, going toward A, until collision

Ethernets have limited lengths of wires because of contention issues

Gigabit ethernet is not ethernet at all because it's point to point... there's no contention. Gigibit is not CSMA/CD . . . because it would be amax of 6'

Mutual Exlcusion in Networked Environment is a nightmare
