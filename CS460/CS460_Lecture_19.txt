Looking at old Silicon Graphics' GTX system architecture based on [AKEL88]

Span processors are just traffic cops - grabs stuff from pixel bus and puts it on minispan bus. Asynchronous

Pixel cache - for when stuff comes in too fast--never happened/never used. Could be used for video

Frame buffer broken up into 20 chunks

Multimedia graphics processor is the output traffic cop... must synchronize each span process output because it's all serial from DAC Multiplexer

The original Star Wars were created with these

Sun XVR-4000= Stereo video -> Virtual Reality
